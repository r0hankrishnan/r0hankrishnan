# Hi 👋, I'm Rohan

#### I'm a recent graduate with majors in Economics and BIS, a minor in Applied Statistics, and a certificate in Business Analytics. I'm also a huge tennis nerd 🎾 🤓 and self-learner with a passion using data and analytics to drive positive change! 

### 🔑 Key Skills:
- Querying data using **SQL**
- Manipulating, cleaning and analyzing data using **R** and/or **Python**
- Developing, testing, and iterating through **predictive** and **econometric statistical** models using **R** and **Python**
- Developing dashboards with **Tableau**, **RShiny**, or **Streamlit**
- Analyzing data and generating reports using **Excel** and **Google Sheets**

### 📽 Projects:
*This is currently a highlight of my most recent completed projects, check out my full [portfolio](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/portfolio/blob/main/README.md) to see all of my projects (completed and ongoing)!*  

#### ✅ Newly Completed:
| Project Link | Technology | Area | Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 🚗 [CarMax Analytics](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/carmax) | Python Programming & Dashboarding | Data Cleaning, EDA, Predictive Modelling, Dimensionality Reduction | (*In process of being reformatted and converted from R to Python*)  Using CarMax trade-in data from the **CarMax Analytics Case Competition**, conducted data cleaning & feature engineering before using visualizations and hypothesis testing to extract business insights about the CarMax trade-in process. Also created a random forest model to predict a traded-in car's value and used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data. | pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter notebooks, scikit-learn, streamlit |

#### 🔨 In The Works:
